Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.

  A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

    Note:
                                                                The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
    Word length will be at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
    Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
